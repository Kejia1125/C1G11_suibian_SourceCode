## 📖 Introduction

### **Challenge 1: Affordable & Clean Energy (SDG 7)**

#### **The Problem**
Cities’ energy use across buildings and transport increases operational costs and carbon emissions.  
Inefficiencies and outdated building management systems persist due to the lack of:  

- Real-time AI-powered optimization  
- Centralized occupancy visibility  
- Automated anomaly detection

## 🔍 Project Overview

### **Project Topic**
**SmartBuilding Monitor — AI-Enhanced Occupancy & Energy Anomaly Detection System**

### **Problem Statement**
Cities, buildings, and campuses consume large amounts of energy, much of which is wasted due to poor occupancy awareness. Most institutions do not know in real time whether rooms are:

- Actively occupied  
- Under-utilized  
- Completely empty  

Without AI-driven optimization, institutions face challenges such as:

- **Energy wastage** from AC, lighting, and appliances running in empty rooms  
- **Outdated, non-automated** building management systems  
- **Lack of real-time occupancy feedback**  
- **No anomaly detection** for abnormal power consumption  
- **Limited scheduling & sustainability insights**  
- **Higher operational costs** and avoidable carbon emissions  

These inefficiencies persist due to the absence of a centralized intelligent monitoring system capable of instantly processing sensor data.
